## Usage

The client uses an async/await-based programming model.

```typescript
import { connect } from 'ts-postgres';

interface Greeting {
  message: string;
}

const client = await connect();

try {
  // The query method is generic on the result row.
  const result = client.query<Greeting>(
    "SELECT 'Hello ' || $1 || '!' AS message",
    ['world'],
  );

  for await (const obj of result) {
    // 'Hello world!'
    console.log(obj.message);
  }
} finally {
  await client.end();
}
```

With TypeScript 5.2+ there is also support for `await using`:
```typescript
await using client = await connect();
// Will be disposed of automatically at the end of the block.
```

Waiting on the result (i.e., result iterator) returns the complete query result.

```typescript
const result = await client.query(...)
```

If the query fails, an exception is thrown.

### Connection options

The client constructor takes an optional
[Configuration](src/client.ts#L88) object.

For example, to connect to a remote host use the _host_ configuration key:

```typescript
const client = await connect({"host": <hostname>});
```

The following table lists the various configuration options and their
default value when applicable.

| Key                     | Type                             | Default                                    |
| ----------------------- | :------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| host                    | `string`                         | "localhost"                                |
| port                    | `number`                         | 5432                                       |
| user                    | `string`                         | _The username of the process owner_        |
| database                | `string`                         | "postgres"                                 |
| password                | `string`                         |                                            |
| types                   | `Map<DataType, ValueTypeReader>` | _Default value mapping for built-in types_ |
| extraFloatDigits        | `number`                         | 0                                          |
| keepAlive               | `boolean`                        | true                                       |
| preparedStatementPrefix | `string`                         | "tsp\_"                                    |
| connectionTimeout       | `number`                         | 10                                         |
| ssl                     | `(SSLMode.Disable \| SSL)`       | `SSLMode.Prefer`                           |

When applicable, "PG" environment variables used by _libpq_ apply, see
the PostgreSQL documentation on [environment
variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html). In
particular, to disable the use of SSL, you can define the environment
variable "PGSSLMODE" as "disable".

### Querying

The `query` method accepts a `Query` object or a number of arguments
that together define the query, the first argument (query text) being
the only required one.

The initial example above could be written as:

```typescript
const query = new Query("SELECT 'Hello ' || $1 || '!' AS message", ['world']);
const result = await client.execute<Greeting>(query);
```

If the object type is omitted, it defaults to `Record<string, any>`, but
providing a type ensures that the object values are typed, both when
accessed via the iterator or record interface (see below).

### Passing query parameters

Query parameters use the format `$1`, `$2` etc.

When a specific data type can't be inferred from the query, PostgreSQL
uses `DataType.Text` as the default data type (which is mapped to the
string type in TypeScript). An explicit type can be provided in two
different ways:

1. Using type cast in the query, e.g. `$1::int`.

2. By passing a list of types to the query method:

   ```typescript
   import { DataType } from 'ts-postgres';
   const result = await client.query(
     "SELECT $1 || ' bottles of beer'",
     [99],
     [DataType.Int4],
   );
   ```

Note that the `number` type in TypeScript has a maximum safe integer
value which is 2⁵³ – 1 (also given in the `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` constant),
a value which lies between `DataType.Int4` and `DataType.Int8`. For numbers
which can take on a value that's outside the safe range, use `DataType.Int8`
(which translates to a `bigint` in TypeScript.)

There's an optional setting `bigints` which can be configured on the client and/or
specified for each query. It defaults to _true_, but can be set to _false_ in which
case `number` is always used instead of `bigint` for `DataType.Int8` (throwing an
error if a query returns a value outside of the safe integer range.)

Using a [check constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html)
is recommended to ensure that values fit into the safe
integer range, e.g. `CHECK (id < POWER(2, 53) - 1)`.

### Iterator interface

The query result can be iterated over, either asynchronously, or after being awaited. The returned objects are reified representations of the result rows, provided as _objects_ of the generic type parameter specified for the query (optional, it defaults to `Record<string, any>`).

To extract all objects from the query result, you can use the _spread_ operator:

```typescript
const result = await client.query('SELECT generate_series(0, 9) AS i');
const objects = [...result];
```

The asynchronous await syntax around for-loops is another option:

```typescript
const result = client.query(...);
for await (const obj of result) {
  console.log('The number is: ' + obj.i); // 1, 2, 3, ...
}
```

### Result interface

The awaited result object provides an interface based on rows and column names.

```typescript
for (const row of result.rows) {
  // Using the array indices:
  console.log('The number is: ' + row[0]); // 1, 2, 3, ...

  // Using the column name:
  console.log('The number is: ' + row.get('i')); // 1, 2, 3, ...
}
```

Column names are available via the `names` property.

### Streaming

A query can support streaming of one or more columns directly into an
asynchronous stream such as a network socket, or a file.

Assuming that `socket` is a writable stream:

```typescript
const query = new Query('SELECT some_bytea_column', {
  streams: { some_bytea_column: socket },
});
const result = await client.execute(query);
```

This can for example be used to reduce time to first byte and memory use.

### Multiple queries

The query command accepts a single query only. If you need to send multiple queries, just call the method multiple times. For example, to send an update command in a transaction:

```typescript
client.query('begin');
client.query('update ...');
await client.query('commit');
```

The queries are sent back to back over the wire, but PostgreSQL still processes them one at a time, in the order they were sent (first in, first out).

### Prepared statements

You can prepare a query and subsequently execute it multiple times. This is also known as a "prepared statement".

```typescript
const statement = await client.prepare(
  `SELECT 'Hello ' || $1 || '!' AS message`,
);
for await (const object of statement.execute(['world'])) {
  console.log(object.message); // 'Hello world!'
}
```

When the prepared statement is no longer needed, it should be closed to release the resource.

```typescript
await statement.close();
```
With TypeScript 5.2+ it's also possible to use the `await using` construct which automatically closes the statement at the end of the block.


Prepared statements can be used (executed) multiple times, even concurrently.

## Notes

Queries with parameters are sent using the prepared statement variant of the extended query protocol. In this variant, the type of each parameter is determined prior to parameter binding, ensuring that values are encoded in the correct format.

If a query has no parameters, it uses the portal variant which saves a round trip.

The copy commands are not supported.

## FAQ

1. _How do I set up a connection pool?_ You can for example use the [generic-pool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generic-pool) library.

   See the [generic-pool](./examples/generic-pool/) code example.

2. _How do I convert column names to camelcase?_ Use the `transform` option:

   ```typescript
   const camelcase = (s: string) => s.replace(/(_\w)/g, k => k[1].toUpperCase());
   const result = client.query({text: ..., transform: camelcase})
   ```

3. _How do I use LISTEN/NOTIFY?_ Send `LISTEN` as a regular query, then subscribe to
   notifications, filtering out the relevant channels.

   ```typescript
   import type { Notification } from 'ts-postgres';

   const channel = 'test';
   client.on('notification', (message: Notification) => {
     if (message.channel === channel) {
       // Do stuff
     }
   });
   await client.query(`LISTEN ${channel}`);
   ```

## Benchmarking

Use the following environment variable to run tests in "benchmark" mode.

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=benchmark npm run test
```
